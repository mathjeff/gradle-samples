    ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis
    framework. It can be used to modify existing classes or to dynamically
    generate classes, directly in binary form. ASM provides some common
    bytecode transformations and analysis algorithms from which custom complex
    transformations and code analysis tools can be built. ASM offers similar
    functionality as other Java bytecode frameworks, but is focused on
    . Because it was designed and
    implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it is well suited for
    use in dynamic systems (but can of course be used in a static way too, e.g.
    in compilers).
    ASM is used in many projects, including:
    
      the , to
      generate the , and also in the 
        ,
      
      the 
         and the  ,
      
      
        
        and , to
          in order to measure code coverage,
      
      
        , to
        dynamically generate  classes (which are used in other projects such as  and ),
      
      
        , to  some classes at runtime.
